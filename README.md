# Groupie Tracker

Groupie Tracker is a Go-based web application that interacts with a RESTful API to fetch and display data about musical artists, their concert locations, dates, and relationships. This project aims to provide an intuitive and structured way to visualize this information.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Groupie Tracker is a web application that fetches and presents data about music artists, their concerts, and related details. Users can explore artist information, past and upcoming concert locations, and their relationships with other events.

## Objectives

The application connects to an API containing four key parts:

- **Artists**: Information about bands and artists, including their names, images, formation year, first album date, and members.
- **Locations**: Locations of their past and/or upcoming concerts.
- **Dates**: Dates of their past and/or upcoming concerts.
- **Relations**: Links between artists, dates, and locations.

The main goal is to build a website that presents this information using various UI components, such as cards, lists, and tables.

## Features

âœ… Fetch and display artist details dynamically.
âœ… Show concert dates and locations in a structured manner.
âœ… Provide a user-friendly interface.
âœ… Implement efficient client-server communication.
âœ… Handle error pages gracefully.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS for UI
- **API**: RESTful API for data retrieval
